# aliases directory
this directory holds files with wrapper functions/aliases for
applications, these will mostly be grouped by applications,
but some functions might touch multiple applications like `start` 
will eventually handle everything related to starting a ticket and
might grow more setup agnostic as time goes on.

### Main Goal
have a consistent set of memorable and useful aliases/functions
for common shell usage.
