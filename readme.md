# DwordPtr's dotfiles
These are my dotfiles that I use for work/play.
My main goals are:

1. Macos/Linux compatibility: I want to be able to move from mac to linux
with these same config files with as little pain as possible.
2. Reproducibleish new computer setup be fast.
3. Useful I want to have stuff in hear that actually saves me time.
4. Readable & Documented

This is very much a work a in progress and I welcome you to fork and 
take stuff from this if it helps you out. Feel free to post an issue if 
you get stumped. Also if you send me a pr for something that helps me 
I'll be very thankful ‚ù§.

## Main trade-offs

1. I optimize for usability over discoverability: The reason why this 
is a mono repo as opposed to a single repo for every app I use is so I can
clone once, run a script and have my config. Someday I'll worry about specifying
dependencies but that takes alot of work.

2. Emphasis on iterability: I want to be able to add improvements as I think
of them. Its easy to do that with centralized config management. 
Occasionally I have time to refactor but I'm a busy man and usually working
on my actual real job. So I have to be able take on tech debt when I'm busy.

Anyway there's some cool stuff in here IMHO and eventually it will mostly be
documented.
